<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
    Class work 2 was a lot of fun. Getting to work with MIT Inventor App was fun to learn. I was happy to see how many
    tutorials
    and documentation was out there supporting this tool. It’s nice to see an active and expansive community supporting
    the app.
    I really appreciated how simple it was to make code and connect your phone, to immediately demo the app live as
    you’re continuing
    to form the logic. A challenge I faced was that I jumped into building too fast and learned about procedures once I
    was done.
    If I had taken more time to research beforehand, I believe my code base would have come out cleaner with increased
    readability.
    MIT Inventor App is great, and I can see the significance of this tool for building a prototype app but not
    enterprise level
    as it does lack some features.
