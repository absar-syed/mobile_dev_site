                    <b>App Description</b><br>
                    This project is a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game. The app offers a fun and engaging experience where players navigate a bird through pipes while trying to avoid obstacles. It includes five distinct screens: a start screen where players input their name and have the option to customize or adjust settings, a settings screen to control volume and other game preferences, a customization screen where users can change the bird's color using in-game points, a game screen where the action takes place, and a leaderboard that connects to a database to track high scores.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>App Deliverables</b><br>
                    The deliverables for this project include the complete set of app features, each accompanied by detailed descriptions and corresponding visual elements such as wireframes or screenshots. The app's first screen, where users can enter their name and choose between starting the game, accessing settings, or customizing the bird, will feature a simple and intuitive design. The settings screen will allow users to control in-game audio levels and, potentially, other preferences to personalize the gameplay experience. The customization screen will showcase a variety of bird colors, which can be unlocked or purchased using points earned during gameplay. This system will give players a sense of progression as they advance through the game. The game screen itself will be highly interactive, focusing on smooth, fluid gameplay mechanics where players control the bird by tapping the screen to navigate through obstacles. The final screen will present a leaderboard, connected to a database, where users can see their rank and compare scores with friends and other players globally. All screens will be designed with user experience in mind, ensuring that the app is easy to navigate, visually appealing, and offers smooth transitions between different features. Visuals will be provided through wireframes or mockups that illustrate how the app will look and function in real-time.

                    <b>App Drawbacks</b><br>
                    Despite its simple and engaging gameplay, the Flappy Bird clone app does have a few notable limitations. One issue is the lack of complexity in the game’s mechanics. The game essentially requires the player to tap the screen to keep the bird in the air, which can quickly become repetitive and boring. Adding more dynamic elements, such as changing speeds or varying obstacles, could improve the player experience by offering more challenge. Another drawback is the limited customization available to the player. Currently, the only customization is the ability to change the bird’s color, which doesn’t offer much variety or personal expression. Expanding customization options to include different bird designs, accessories, or even gameplay styles could make the app more appealing. Additionally, the game relies on an internet connection for displaying the leaderboard, which may not always be ideal for players in low-connectivity areas. A local leaderboard would be a great fallback option for players who prefer to play offline. Lastly, the game’s static background might not be engaging enough for players in the long run. It could be more visually stimulating if the background included moving clouds or varying weather conditions, offering a more immersive experience.

                    You are then met with the Homepage where you can see 2 buttons, one for the settings page and the other for the leaderboard. The background is a png that infinitely moves to the left giving a flying look. The bird is animated with a simple 2-frame animation from a spritesheet to appear as though it is flapping its wings. To initiate gameplay simply tap on the screen to start and you are off.

                    From the homepage, after tapping on the leaderboard, the player is met with the leaderboard screen showing the top five players with the highest score. This page fetches its data from the Firebase Cloud Firestore Database. The data is updated every time you click on this page. After the table, you can see we display the player’s name, highest score, total coins they have accumulated, and another button to direct the player back to the homepage.

                    From the homepage, once the player taps on the screen, the app title and buttons disappear, and the pipes begin to move in from the right, giving a seamless transition from the homepage to gameplay. The pipes will randomly generate infinitely, and only 5 pipes are kept in the game at a time to avoid creating a memory leak. A gold coin remains in between each pipe pair which will serve as the points system with the counter being displayed at the top of the screen.

                    Our final screen of the app is the game over screen. It displays once the player makes contact with the pipes. It displays the score as “Coins earned:” and has a button that returns the player back to the homepage.

                    <b>Reflections</b><br>
                    <b>Absar - Functionality Developer</b><br>
                    Reflecting on this project, I can look back on this and say I have learned a lot and have enjoyed it thoroughly. I put together the frontend, game logic, all screens, and functionalities, aside from backend services. This learning to make a game was a lot of fun and something I have been wanting to do for a while. Even though I faced a lot of challenges, I had fun solving them. The biggest challenge by far was just having to learn everything. As Flutter was new to me, I was essentially going off nothing, consuming a lot of time with reading documentation and watching hours-long tutorials on 2x speed. I eventually found Flame, a 2D game engine for Flutter, which gave me more direction in building, but yet another thing to learn. It does not help how Dart structures its builds with continuous nesting of components. Eventually, you must encapsulate parts of a build into its own class for readability. To reiterate, the biggest challenge was how time-consuming learning Flutter and Flame was, nevertheless I enjoyed every bit of it.

                    <b>Ali - Backend Developer</b><br>
                    Developing this app was both a challenging and deeply rewarding experience. From conceptualizing the app to implementing its core features, the journey was filled with learning opportunities and moments of creativity. Conceptualizing the gameplay and outlining the app's structure came naturally, as the game's logic and features felt intuitive to design. However, bringing these ideas to life required a steep learning curve. Integrating Firebase was my first experience working with a cloud-based backend, and learning its concepts—from authentication to Firestore configuration—was both daunting and fascinating. Setting up the database to store player scores, purchased skins, and in-game points required me to learn Firebase's structure and best practices. Like the frontend, I faced numerous hurdles when trying to make everything work seamlessly. Initially, I found Firebase's documentation overwhelming and difficult to navigate. Tasks like configuring authentication, setting up real-time updates for the leaderboard, and managing data security were frustrating at times, as I was essentially starting from scratch. However, as I experimented and explored, I began to see how powerful Firebase could be. With every small breakthrough—whether it was successfully saving data to Firestore or implementing user-specific configurations—I felt a sense of accomplishment that made the effort worthwhile. This project not only deepened my understanding of mobile app development but also introduced me to the intricacies of working with backend services. It strengthened my problem-solving skills and taught me to be resourceful when navigating complex frameworks and third-party tools. Overall, I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished and excited to apply these skills to future projects.

                    <b>Takirul - UX/UI Designer</b><br>
                    As the UI/UX designer for our Flappy Bird game, my involvement was minimal, and the design ended up being a bit of a mess. From the very start, I didn’t understand the requirements well, and I assumed that creating a simple, minimal interface would be enough. I didn’t consider the app’s core functionality or its user experience thoroughly enough. I quickly sketched a basic wireframe without much thought or effort, and even though it was approved by the team, the mockups didn’t represent the feel of the game at all. The colors I chose were too bright, and I didn’t consider how they might affect gameplay. For instance, the background color clashed with the bird and obstacles, making it hard to distinguish the key elements of the game. The buttons were poorly placed, and the layout didn’t offer any clarity or intuitive navigation. Instead of focusing on making the user interface smooth and engaging, I just threw together a simple menu and game screen, hoping it would work without further refinement. I didn’t take time to plan out the flow of the game, and because of this, the game felt disjointed. The text on the screens was hard to read, and the icons were too small, which made it difficult for players to understand how to navigate the app. I didn’t do much testing or seek feedback from the team until the app was nearly finished, which meant I had no opportunity to make meaningful changes. When it came to the design of the interactive elements, I didn’t take advantage of animations or subtle transitions to enhance the user experience. The bird flapping, for example, didn’t look fluid, and the game didn’t have any sound effects or animations to make it feel immersive. I could have added a visual cue for the score or made the game controls more accessible, but I didn’t focus on those elements. The settings page was also a missed opportunity for user interaction—what could have been a space to allow players to adjust difficulty or sound settings turned out to be a bare-bones page with little functionality.

                <h2>The Mobile Revolution: Mobile Banking</h2>
                <p>Mobile banking has without a doubt changed the landscape of the financial sector for the better. With the inclusion
                    of the smartphone and the ever-present societal expectation of everyone always having a device on them, it came with
                    a new way of banking and a cashless economy. Some things that mobile banking has done to improve the financial
                    sector are financial inclusion, cost reductions, and enhanced customer experiences. It is important to consider that
                    it does not come without its own set of challenges, such as the security challenge. Nevertheless, the good far
                    outweigh the bad and mobile banking has without a doubt changed the landscape of the financial sector for the
                    better.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Financial inclusion</strong> is a term that people may not have heard of but are living it daily. Through
                    mobile banking, the ability to access financial services has greatly and dramatically increased. With many people
                    across the globe living in developing countries where the infrastructure is not as strong, the opportunity to bank
                    off your device has become a godsend. People in rural areas where the nearest physical branch location is too far
                    away benefit greatly from this.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Cost reductions</strong> due to mobile banking are massive. Automation of routine processes has reduced the
                    need for physical branches and staffing, leading to cost reduction. With the move to an online system, banks have a
                    lesser need to print money. Another cost reduction, with the bonus of becoming more environmentally friendly, has
                    been achieved.</p>
                
                <p>One way enhanced user experience is shown is with the new standard of accessibility. 24/7 banking services are
                    available to you on your device. Services like managing your accounts, checking your balance, making payments,
                    transferring funds between accounts, and so on are always at the customer’s fingertips.</p>
                
                <p>It is always important to note that challenges come with everything. In this case, the challenge of
                    <strong>security</strong> is always present. Your money should always be secure, but there are people who do intend
                    to steal. These can happen through socially engineered attacks such as phishing or with a weak authentication method
                    such as a single password. The good news is that with some education and multi-factor authentication, these are
                    easily avoidable.</p>
                
                <p>Mobile banking showcases its implication to the financial sector in ways such as bringing about a greater level of
                    inclusion, increasing savings, and enhancing the customers’ experience. Not without its challenge of security, that
                    can be easily quelled with education and proper authentication methods in place. Mobile banking has without a doubt
                    changed the landscape of the financial sector for the better.</p>

                    heart and an Apple hater to the core. We have this discussion all the time about which is better. I always say
                    android and she will always say Apple. I have laid out this chart detailing just a few out of the many
                    specifications where Samsung trumps over Apple. The winner is and always will be android and Samsung.</p>

                <p>The Virgin plan is my own personal plan, and the Fido is the equivalent I could find on their website. It’s important
                    to note that this is my LOY+ plan, meaning I gained access to this plan by staying with Virgin for 2+ years. They
                    are practically the same service but there are some crucial differences. Bell has some of the best infrastructure
                    and fastest networks today, and Virgin can access their network as the child company. Looking at the consensus from
                    user reviews, Virgin takes the cake with their quality of service. And on top of that, the Virgin plan is more
                    affordable. Total monthly payments are $50.85 a month for Virgin, and for Fido, it’s $61.02 per month, giving a
                    difference of $10.17. Virgin easily takes the win here with essentially the same features but with better service
                    and pricing.</p>

                    I enjoyed this lab but unfortunately was unable to complete it. I had a plan to make a temperature converter app,
                    where it converts a number between Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin. A challenge I faced during this lab was getting
                    the emulators to work correctly. I had issues with getting them to run or open in Android Studio. I assumed it was
                    due
                    to my underperforming laptop, so I switched to my desktop workstation and it began to work again. I’ve found
                    Bluestacks
                    to be more reliable than the emulator found in Android Studio, as it works on my laptop as well.

                <h2>Topic Overview: Generics</h2>
                
                <h3>Definition</h3>
                <p>
                    Generics in Dart and in general is a type-safe way to write flexible, reusable code that can work with different
                    data types.
                    In other words, generics are not specific to any particular data type. With generics, you can define classes,
                    methods,
                    and functions without a strictly defined data type but instead can pass in any data type using type parameters.
                    These type parameters, which look like <code>&lt;T&gt;</code>, are used as placeholders for when a data type is
                    passed through.
                </p>
                
                <h3>How & Why</h3>
                <p>
                    Generics are used for clean, type-safe, reusable code. There are cases in which the exact same class, method or
                    function
                    are recreated because it requires a different data type. With generics, you do not need to duplicate your code
                    for different
                    data types but can simply write one class, method or function and have different data types be passed through
                    it, while still
                    maintaining type safety.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Comparisons</h3>
                <p>
                    One comparison with similar or related programming concepts in Dart to generics would be dynamic typing. Dynamic
                    typing is when
                    you declare the data type of a variable as ‘dynamic’ allowing it to change types at runtime. You can also use
                    type inference by
                    declaring <code>var</code> and it will default to a dynamic data type. Dynamic typing has flexibility with its
                    code with no runtime
                    errors just like generics but lacks type safety.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Advantages & Limitations</h3>
                <p>
                    Some advantages of generics in Dart are that it is type-safe, promotes code reusability, and can improve
                    performance. When using
                    generics, it ensures that you catch type-related errors at compile time instead of runtime, reducing the chance
                    of bugs.
                    Generics promote reusability by working with any data type, making them flexible as well. They improve
                    performance by eliminating
                    the need for type checks at runtime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some limitations of generics in Dart include the complexity of the code and some constraints during runtime.
                    Generics can make
                    your code more complex and difficult to read, especially for those who are not familiar with the concept. Dart’s
                    runtime type
                    checking does not always work well with generics due to Dart’s type erasure.
                </p>

                <h4>Issues or Considerations</h4>
                <p>
                    I didn’t have much issue with generating this example. I had thoroughly researched the concept and felt I had a
                    strong
                    understanding of what generics are. I did however find it difficult to come up with an idea to implement the
                    concept.
                    I looked towards YouTube for inspiration and saw what others have made. I found a few videos explaining and
                    demoing generics
                    in a simple way. In their examples, it was common for them to use different data type arrays, which sparked my
                    own idea for
                    implementation. I am pleased with this example as I have implemented a new concept that I have learned in a
                    straightforward manner.

                <h4>Issues or Considerations</h4>
                <p>
                    This example showcases how generics are used when only numeric data types are needed for arithmetic and how we
                    can use
                    generics to constrain certain data types. It might sound counterintuitive because generics are supposed to allow
                    for the
                    pass-through of all data types. In the case of needing all numeric data types for a math operation, this can be
                    used as
                    a possible solution. With this approach, you do not have to explicitly state <code>int</code> and
                    <code>double</code> and can
                    reduce the amount of code. I also showcase the same concept being done with the <code>String</code> data type
                    for only accepting
                    alphabet characters. I personally do not see the value in this implementation, as Dart considers
                    <code>char</code> as a
                    <code>String</code> as well. So, <code>&lt;T extends String&gt;</code> is not different from
                    <code>&lt;String&gt;</code>
                    therefore, it becomes unnecessary.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Real-World Scenario</h3>
                <p>
                    A real-world scenario that implements generics with Flutter in mind would be generic widgets. Since widgets are
                    the building
                    block of mobile app development, it can become repetitive to have to build so many widgets. With generic
                    widgets, you can
                    increase code reusability, reduce code duplication all while being type-safe and flexible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine a fitness tracking app that aims to have a dashboard that displays multiple different metrics of your
                    activities.
                    Using generic widgets, you can create a widget that displays any metric of any data type. This allows for a more
                    uniform
                    look that shows consistency in design, which can enhance the user’s experience. Also, the code reusability
                    allows for reduced
                    code duplication and increases maintainability as any changes to the widget are done in one place.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time developing a mobile app and I’ve been very excited to start. This felt daunting at first, but
                    the more
                    I played around with it, the more comfortable I began to feel. I enjoyed using the Android Studio IDE. I already
                    favour JetBrains
                    IDEs like IntelliJ, and this is built off it so I felt right at home with the software. The biggest challenge was
                    getting my external
                    Android emulator, BlueStack 5, working as I wished. I was researching how I could make it so that Android Studio
                    would automatically
                    connect to it with Android Debugging Bridge (adb), but I could not get it to work. I ended up using the way that was
                    taught in class
                    by simply installing the apk onto the emulator. Another challenge was when I was laying out my textviews and ran my
                    app internally,
                    it would all render at (0,0). I had not put constraints on any of my elements. I compare this to my experience with
                    C# and Visual Studio
                    where you can drag and drop elements with no issues. I assumed it would be the same case with Android Studio. I
                    found this to be a fun
                    and exciting exercise and am looking forward to learning and creating more.

                    Class work 2 was a lot of fun. Getting to work with MIT Inventor App was fun to learn. I was happy to see how many
                    tutorials
                    and documentation was out there supporting this tool. It’s nice to see an active and expansive community supporting
                    the app.
                    I really appreciated how simple it was to make code and connect your phone, to immediately demo the app live as
                    you’re continuing
                    to form the logic. A challenge I faced was that I jumped into building too fast and learned about procedures once I
                    was done.
                    If I had taken more time to research beforehand, I believe my code base would have come out cleaner with increased
                    readability.
                    MIT Inventor App is great, and I can see the significance of this tool for building a prototype app but not
                    enterprise level
                    as it does lack some features.

                    This was an informative exercise and one I have been looking forward to. I’ve been looking forward to learning
                    Flutter as mobile
                    development for both iOS and Android with a single code base just makes sense. It was fun to research and learn
                    about Flutter and
                    Dart and get to know them. It’s fun and intuitive and I can’t wait for more. I do find the structure of Dart and
                    Flutter to be
                    difficult to understand. With time and practice, I will get it.
