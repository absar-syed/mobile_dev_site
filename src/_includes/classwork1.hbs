<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
    This was my first time developing a mobile app and Iâ€™ve been very excited to start. This felt daunting at first, but
    the more
    I played around with it, the more comfortable I began to feel. I enjoyed using the Android Studio IDE. I already
    favour JetBrains
    IDEs like IntelliJ, and this is built off it so I felt right at home with the software. The biggest challenge was
    getting my external
    Android emulator, BlueStack 5, working as I wished. I was researching how I could make it so that Android Studio
    would automatically
    connect to it with Android Debugging Bridge (adb), but I could not get it to work. I ended up using the way that was
    taught in class
    by simply installing the apk onto the emulator. Another challenge was when I was laying out my textviews and ran my
    app internally,
    it would all render at (0,0). I had not put constraints on any of my elements. I compare this to my experience with
    C# and Visual Studio
    where you can drag and drop elements with no issues. I assumed it would be the same case with Android Studio. I
    found this to be a fun
    and exciting exercise and am looking forward to learning and creating more.
