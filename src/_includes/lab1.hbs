<h2>The Mobile Revolution: Mobile Banking</h2>
<p>Mobile banking has without a doubt changed the landscape of the financial sector for the better. With the inclusion
    of the smartphone and the ever-present societal expectation of everyone always having a device on them, it came with
    a new way of banking and a cashless economy. Some things that mobile banking has done to improve the financial
    sector are financial inclusion, cost reductions, and enhanced customer experiences. It is important to consider that
    it does not come without its own set of challenges, such as the security challenge. Nevertheless, the good far
    outweigh the bad and mobile banking has without a doubt changed the landscape of the financial sector for the
    better.</p>

<p><strong>Financial inclusion</strong> is a term that people may not have heard of but are living it daily. Through
    mobile banking, the ability to access financial services has greatly and dramatically increased. With many people
    across the globe living in developing countries where the infrastructure is not as strong, the opportunity to bank
    off your device has become a godsend. People in rural areas where the nearest physical branch location is too far
    away benefit greatly from this.</p>

<p><strong>Cost reductions</strong> due to mobile banking are massive. Automation of routine processes has reduced the
    need for physical branches and staffing, leading to cost reduction. With the move to an online system, banks have a
    lesser need to print money. Another cost reduction, with the bonus of becoming more environmentally friendly, has
    been achieved.</p>

<p>One way enhanced user experience is shown is with the new standard of accessibility. 24/7 banking services are
    available to you on your device. Services like managing your accounts, checking your balance, making payments,
    transferring funds between accounts, and so on are always at the customer’s fingertips.</p>

<p>It is always important to note that challenges come with everything. In this case, the challenge of
    <strong>security</strong> is always present. Your money should always be secure, but there are people who do intend
    to steal. These can happen through socially engineered attacks such as phishing or with a weak authentication method
    such as a single password. The good news is that with some education and multi-factor authentication, these are
    easily avoidable.</p>

<p>Mobile banking showcases its implication to the financial sector in ways such as bringing about a greater level of
    inclusion, increasing savings, and enhancing the customers’ experience. Not without its challenge of security, that
    can be easily quelled with education and proper authentication methods in place. Mobile banking has without a doubt
    changed the landscape of the financial sector for the better.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S23 FE is the phone I own, and the Apple iPhone 14 Plus is my wife’s phone. I am an android fan at
    heart and an Apple hater to the core. We have this discussion all the time about which is better. I always say
    android and she will always say Apple. I have laid out this chart detailing just a few out of the many
    specifications where Samsung trumps over Apple. The winner is and always will be android and Samsung.</p>

<p>The Virgin plan is my own personal plan, and the Fido is the equivalent I could find on their website. It’s important
    to note that this is my LOY+ plan, meaning I gained access to this plan by staying with Virgin for 2+ years. They
    are practically the same service but there are some crucial differences. Bell has some of the best infrastructure
    and fastest networks today, and Virgin can access their network as the child company. Looking at the consensus from
    user reviews, Virgin takes the cake with their quality of service. And on top of that, the Virgin plan is more
    affordable. Total monthly payments are $50.85 a month for Virgin, and for Fido, it’s $61.02 per month, giving a
    difference of $10.17. Virgin easily takes the win here with essentially the same features but with better service
    and pricing.</p>
