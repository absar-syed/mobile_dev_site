<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
    This was an informative exercise and one I have been looking forward to. I’ve been looking forward to learning
    Flutter as mobile
    development for both iOS and Android with a single code base just makes sense. It was fun to research and learn
    about Flutter and
    Dart and get to know them. It’s fun and intuitive and I can’t wait for more. I do find the structure of Dart and
    Flutter to be
    difficult to understand. With time and practice, I will get it.
